          <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">How to Find Last-Minute Cheap Flights with Tripcanny?</h1>
          <p>
            Step 1: Embrace Flexibility: Flexibility is key when it comes to securing last-minute flights at great
            prices. Consider being open to flying late or opting for red-eye flights, which often come with more
            affordable price tags compared to daytime options. While it may require sacrificing some sleep, the savings
            can be well worth it
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 2: Leverage Your Airline Miles: Don't underestimate the value of your accumulated airline miles. By
            preserving your air miles for those spontaneous travel needs, you can enjoy significant savings on
            last-minute flights. Whether it's a short domestic hop or an international journey, your airline miles can
            serve as a valuable resource, making those impromptu trips more budget-friendly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 3: Explore Multiple Destinations: Keeping an open mind about your destination can lead to exciting
            opportunities and great deals. By considering multiple locations for your last-minute getaway, you increase
            your chances of finding the perfect flight deal with Tripcanny. Whether you're in the mood for a beach
            escape, a city adventure, or a mountain retreat, our extensive network of flights offers something for every

          </p>
          <p>
            Step 4: Opt for Budget-Friendly Airlines: When booking last-minute flights, consider flying with low-cost
            carriers to maximize your savings. While budget airlines may offer fewer amenities compared to their
            full-service counterparts, they often provide significantly cheaper ticket options. By prioritizing your
            budget and flexibility, you can enjoy more affordable fares without sacrificing the quality of your travel
            experience.

          <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">How Late Can You Book a Flight?</h1>
          <p>
            While specific policies may vary among airlines, as a general rule, you can typically book a flight up to
            two hours before the scheduled departure time. This flexibility allows travelers to make spontaneous
            decisions and embark on last-minute adventures with ease. However, it's essential to note that availability
            may be limited closer to the departure time, so quick decision-making is key when booking last-minute
            flights.
